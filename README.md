# Sample-Rate-Converter

This was a quick little conversion tool that I created for a friend of mine who works as an audio engineer.  The purpose of the converter is to be able to find the sample rate value required to stretch or shrink an audio file so that it matches the duration and pitch of another like audio file.  This situation is often encountered in audio post production where PAL (25fps) foreign audio needs to be stretched to match an NTSC (23.98fps/29.97fps) version of the same program material (usually in English).  

Sorry.  No comments in the code.  I know this is a no-no but, in this case, the program is so short that I didn't worry about not being to figure out what I did.
